        <h1>WHAT IS YOGA</h1>
<p>
    In terms of practice, Yoga is a discipline that over 300 million people around the world are actively engaged in. The word “Yoga” literally means “union,” and refers to an inner state where one experiences everything as a part of oneself. Often mistaken for a system of physical exercise, the Yogic system is actually a set of tools for self-transformation that are designed to bring one to this state of union.
