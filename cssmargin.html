    <h1>BRUCE LEE</h1>
<p>>Bruce Lee (November 27, 1940 â€“ July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong and American martial artist, martial arts instructor, actor, director, screenwriter, producer, and philosopher.

Michael Jai White will say something he doesn't really think, like Jackie Chan beats Bruce. The whole world thinking Bruce was the best fighter, hands down, with no arguments, really does cause resentment. So, Joe Rogan will say Gene Lebell beats Bruce in return. It's a case of some people trying to level the playing field.</h1>
