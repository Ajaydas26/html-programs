<h1 class="m">HITMAN CODENAME 47</h1>
<p class="v">Hitman: Codename 47 is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows in November 2000. In the game, players control Agent 47, a genetically enhanced human clone who is rigorously trained in methods of murder. Upon escaping from his testing facility, 47 is hired by the International Contract Agency (ICA), a global contract killing organization. His missions take him to locations in Asia, Europe, and South America to assassinate wealthy and decadent criminals, who at first seem to share no connections with each other, but are soon revealed to have all played a role in a larger conspiracy. The gameplay revolves around finding ways to stealthily reach and eliminate each target; to this end, players can make use of various tools, including disguises and suppressed weaponry. However, some levels are more action-focused and do not feature stealth as a possibility, instead playing like a traditional third-person shooter. </p>
